## How to fight with enemies?

futhermore we can fire with enemies with spacekey. when you press space on keyboard, a bullet will shoot.
fortunately we have three lives in this game and we can continue playing game even we let enemies pass us and enter our planet for two times.


### Remember this point:

Anytime you collision with one of the enemies, you will lose and game over.

### Using Thread

+ In this version of code ,i have used Thread module for creating enemies , so each of the enemy will be built after 3 sec.
In this program, threading is used to create enemies
An attractive game for entertainment and leisure.


## Game over modes:
1. Run out of player hearts.
2. The player's spaceship crashes with the enemy's spaceship.
